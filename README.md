# post-vax-ae-attendance

This is the code for a short study investigating the causes (discharge diagnoses) of A&E attendances shortly after vacacination. It is no longer under active development.

It was prompted by the apparent increase in A&E visits in the first few days following vaccination. Ultimately, this was due to a combination of patients with "no abnormality detected", some relatively common, mild vaccine-related side-effects, and a small number of rare and serious side-effects which are more robustly investigated elsewhere.
