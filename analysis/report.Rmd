# Introduction

Three vaccines have been used as part of the national COVID-19 vaccination programme in England to date: Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA (*BNT162b2*), Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (*ChAdOx1*), and Moderna mRNA-1273 (*Moderna*). This report describes rates of attendances to accident and emergency departments (A&E) in the first 2 weeks following the first dose of these vaccines. 

The code and data for this report can be found at the OpenSafely [post-vax-ae_attendances GitHub repository](https://github.com/opensafely/post-vax-ae-attendances). 


# Methods

People meeting the following criteria are included:

* People receiving their ever first vaccine dose as part of the national COVID-19 vaccination programme (i.e., not administered in clinical trials):
  * BNT162b2 received on or after `r format(as.Date(studydates$start_date_pfizer), "%d %B %Y")`;
  * ChAdOx1 received on or after `r format(as.Date(studydates$start_date_az), "%d %B %Y")`;
  * Moderna received on or after `r format(as.Date(studydates$start_date_moderna), "%d %B %Y")`.
* Registered at a GP practice using TPP's SystmOne clinical information system on the day before vaccination.
* Aged 16 or over.

The vaccination brand is available in the GP record directly, via the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS).

A&E attendances are identified using linked data from the Emergency Care Data Set (ECDS) provided by NHS Digital's Secondary Use Service (SUS), which holds records on all attendances to A&E departments. For each A&E attendance, one or more diagnosis codes are recorded. These have been categorised into `r nrow(lookup)` categories, detailed below.

Vaccine recipients are classified into one of the [10 vaccine priority groups defined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1007737/Greenbook_chapter_14a_30July2021.pdf#page=12) expert working group. These are based on demographic, clinical, or occupational characteristics identified on or before the vaccination date, except for age, which is determined as of 31 March 2020.

# Results

Note all counts below 6 are redacted and survival estimates are rounded for disclosure control.

## Characteristics as at vaccination date

### Overall
```{r table1, echo=FALSE}
read_rds(here("output", "table1", "table1.rds"))
```


## Vaccination dates


### Overall
```{r, vaxdate, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='80%', results='asis'}
  vaxdate_plot <- read_rds(here("output", "vaxdate", "plot_vaxdate_stack.rds"))
  print(vaxdate_plot)
  cat("  \n\n")
```

### By JCVI priority group

```{r, vaxdate_jcvi, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.height=8, results='asis'}
  vaxdate_plot <- read_rds(here("output", "vaxdate", "plot_vaxdate_stack_jcvi.rds"))
  print(vaxdate_plot)
  cat("  \n\n")
```

## A&E attendances

### Overall

```{r, surv, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='80%', results='asis'}
  surv_plot <- read_rds(here("output", "diagnoses", "plot_any_surv.rds"))
  print(surv_plot)
  cat("  \n\n")
```

### Diagnosis-specific attendances

```{r, surv_diagnosis, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.height=6, results='asis'}

  for (diagnosis in lookup$diagnosis_short){
    
    dignosis_long <- lookup$diagnosis_long[lookup$diagnosis_short == diagnosis]
    
    cat("#### ", dignosis_long)
    cat("  \n\n")  
    surv_plot <- read_rds(here("output", "diagnoses", glue("plot_{diagnosis}_surv.rds")))
    print(surv_plot+ggtitle(NULL))
    cat("  \n\n")  
    
    surv_plot_month <- read_rds(here("output", "diagnoses", glue("plot_{diagnosis}_surv_month.rds")))
    print(surv_plot_month+ggtitle("By month of vaccination"))
    cat("  \n\n")  
    
    surv_plot_jcvi <- read_rds(here("output", "diagnoses", glue("plot_{diagnosis}_surv_jcvi.rds")))
    print(surv_plot_jcvi+ggtitle("By JCVI group"))
    
    cat("  \n\n")  
  }
